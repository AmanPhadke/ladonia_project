                <h2>Aman Phadke</h2>
                <p class="chef-position">The Pizza Poet & Flame Whisperer</p>
                <p>Aman Phadke is a culinary genius known for fusing Greek tradition with bold, modern twists. With years of experience and a taste for perfection, he crafts each dish like a timeless work of art. Guests often say he bears a striking resemblance to Ryan Gosling—but here’s the secret: he is Ryan Gosling. He just chose pizza over Hollywood.

                <h2>Bhallaldev</h2>
                <p class="chef-position">Iron-Fisted Executive Chef</p>
                <p>Once a mighty warrior prince, now the undisputed king of the kitchen—Bhallaldev rules the culinary world with the same intensity he once brought to the battlefield. Every knife in his kitchen is an extension of his will. Precision, power, and perfection define his cooking style.

                He doesn’t just grill, he conquers fire. His signature dishes are bold, heavily spiced, and unapologetically indulgent—just like him. Whispers in the kitchen say he crushes olives with his bare hands and once kneaded dough using only his glare. Whether he’s roasting lamb or crafting a towering gyro, Chef Bhallaldev believes every meal should feel like a royal feast—or a declaration of war.</p>

                <h2>Florence Pugh</h2>
                <p class="chef-position">The Whisk-Wielding Wonder</p>
                <p >Florence Pugh brings the same heart, grace, and fearless energy to the kitchen that she brings to the screen. A true culinary romantic, she believes food is storytelling—each dish a scene, every flavor a feeling. From rustic Greek flatbreads to slow-roasted rosemary lamb, her creations are equal parts comforting and captivating.

                Her signature move? Cooking barefoot, humming vintage jazz, and serving meals that make people pause mid-bite. Don’t let the soft smile fool you—Florence can slice onions faster than most chefs can finish plating. Behind the apron is an artist, a nurturer, and a little bit of kitchen chaos—all in perfect balance.</p>

                <h2>Arpit Bala</h2>
                <p class="chef-position">The Maverick of the Kitchen</p>
                <p >Arpit Bala doesn’t follow recipes—recipes follow him. Known for his unpredictable flavor combos and devilishly smooth plating, he brings raw energy and a spark of madness to every dish. Whether he’s tossing dough mid-air or torching a dessert while cracking a joke, Arpit makes cooking look like a rock concert.

                His secret ingredient? Vibes. Lots of them. From fiery Greek pizzas to desserts that taste like nostalgia, everything he touches becomes a conversation starter. Rumor has it he once cooked an entire meal blindfolded—and it still got a standing ovation.</p>
